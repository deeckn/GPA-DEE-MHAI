# GPA-DEE-MHAI

A university GPA calculator.\
Inspiration: It's hard to find an online GPA calculator with the same grading system as my country. So, why not build my own GPA calculator?

## Skills Improved
By doing this mini project, I learned to
- Practice writing semantic markup
- Generate HTML elements using the DOM
- Write functional code
- Use \<select> and \<option> tags for user input
- Use key-value pair objects

The best part is that I will be able to use this every term of my university life :)
